# Wireless "SOILSENS-V5W" and Wired ["SOILSENS-V5"](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/SOILSENS-V5)

The SOILSENS-V5W is a reliable wireless capacitive soil moisture sensor that utilizes "ESP-NOW or Wi-Fi" for connectivity. It includes a soil temperature sensor, an air humidity and temperature sensor, and a light intensity sensor. One of its key advantages is that the capacitive sensor electrodes are embedded within the inner layer of the PCB, providing protection. It boasts very low power consumption, a compact design, long-range capabilities in ESP-NOW mode, and configuration changes can be made without the need for reflashing. Additionally, it supports MQTT Autodiscovery through CapiBridge in ESP-NOW mode or simple Wi-Fi, making it 100% compatible with Home Assistant.

# Initial Power On and Default Operation
- SOILSENS-V5W supports two modes: ESP-NOW and WiFi for MQTT-based connectivity.
- Upon powering on, the SOILSENS-V5W operates in ESP-NOW mode by default. This mode does not require any initial configuration and communicates directly with the [Capibridge gateway](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/CapiBridge). The default Gateway Key is "xy"

   - Press and hold the calibration button.
   - While holding the calibration button, briefly press the trigger button.
   - Continue holding the calibration button for more than 3 seconds and release it.
   - The blue LED will blink **five times**, indicating the device has entered configuration mode.

2. **Access Configuration via WiFi:**
   - After entering configuration mode, the sensor creates a WiFi Access Point (AP) named `SOILSENS-V5W`.
   - Connect to this AP using the default password: `password`.
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` to access the configuration page.


| Mode ESP-NOW | Mode Wi-Fi |
|--------------|------------|
| Requires node name and key. | Only the key is not required. |
| ![Image 1](img/hotspot1.jpg) | ![Image 2](img/hotspot2.jpg) |


3. **Web Configuration:**
   - **Node Name:** Enter a unique name for your sensor.
   - **Gateway Key:** Enter the key for the [Capibridge gateway.](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/CapiBridge) for WIFI Mode not required
   - **Mode:** Select the desired mode:
     - **1 (ESP-NOW):** Selects ESP-NOW Protocol "Long-Range".
     - **0 (WiFi):** Selects standard WiFi and MQTT setup.
   - For WiFi mode:
     - **WiFi SSID:** Enter your WiFi network name.
     - **Password:** Enter the WiFi password.
     - **MAC Address:** Specify the Access point MAC address "9b:84:5a.....".

After entering the necessary information, click **Submit** to save the configuration. The sensor will restart with the new settings.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Entering to configuration mode will erase all current settings. Therefore, if you enter configuration mode without saving any changes, all settings will revert to their factory defaults, such as `ESP-NOW` with Key `xy`.


## 2. Calibrating the Soil Moisture Sensor

Accurate soil moisture readings require proper calibration. Follow these steps:
   - Put the sensor in dry soil.
   - Press and hold the calibration button.
   - While holding the calibration button, briefly press the trigger button.
   - Continue holding the calibration button for less than 2 seconds and release it.
   - The blue LED will blink twice, indicating the start of `dry soil` calibration.
   - The device will complete the calibration, indicated by three blinks.
   - Place the sensor in fully wet soil, you have 5 seconds to do so.
   - The blue LED will blink twice, indicating the start of `wet soil` calibration.
   - The device will complete the `wet soil` calibration, indicated by three blinks.


> [!IMPORTANT]
>  ‚ö†Ô∏è Until the soil moisture sensor calibration is not performed, the sensor reading will be 0.


# Do you want to assemble it yourself?
<img src="img/sens-kc-pcb.png"/>
This project is open-source, enabling you to assemble SOILSENS-V5W yourself. To make this easier, I've included an 'Interactive HTML BOM File' in the PCB folder, which guides you on where to solder each component and indicates polarity, minimizing the chance of errors. I've invested a lot of time and money into making this project open-source. Your support, whether through buying a ready-made device from my shop www.PricelessToolkit.com subscribing to my YouTube channel, or buying me a coffee, is greatly appreciated and helps fund future projects.
