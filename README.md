# Wireless "SOILSENS-V5W" and Wired ["SOILSENS-V5"](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/SOILSENS-V5)

The SOILSENS-V5W is a reliable wireless capacitive soil moisture sensor that utilizes `ESP-NOW or Wi-Fi` for connectivity. It includes a soil temperature sensor, an air humidity and temperature sensor, and a light intensity sensor. One of its key advantages is that the capacitive sensor electrodes are embedded within the inner layer of the PCB, providing protection. It boasts very low power consumption, a compact design, long-range capabilities in ESP-NOW mode, and configuration changes can be made without the need for reflashing. Additionally, it supports MQTT Autodiscovery through CapiBridge in ESP-NOW mode or simple Wi-Fi, making it 100% compatible with Home Assistant.

# Initial Power On and Default Operation
- SOILSENS-V5W supports two modes: `ESP-NOW` and `WiFi` for MQTT-based connectivity.
- Upon powering on, the SOILSENS-V5W operates in ESP-NOW mode by default. This mode does not require any initial configuration and communicates directly with the [Capibridge gateway](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/CapiBridge). The default Gateway Key is "xy"

| Mode ESP-NOW | Mode Wi-Fi |
|--------------|------------|
| Default Node name and key. | Only the key is not required. |
| ![Image 1](img/hotspot1.jpg) | ![Image 2](img/hotspot2.jpg) |


3. **Web Configuration:**
   - **Node Name:** Enter a unique name for your sensor.
   - **Gateway Key:** Enter the key for the [Capibridge gateway.](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/CapiBridge) for WIFI Mode not required
   - **Mode:** Select the desired mode:
     - **1 (ESP-NOW):** Selects ESP-NOW Protocol "Long-Range".
     - **0 (WiFi):** Selects standard WiFi and MQTT setup.
   - For WiFi mode:
     - **WiFi SSID:** Enter your WiFi network name.

After entering the necessary information, click **Submit** to save the configuration. The sensor will restart with the new settings.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Entering to configuration mode will erase all current settings. Therefore, if you enter configuration mode without saving any changes, all settings will revert to their factory defaults, such as `ESP-NOW` with Key `xy`.


## 2. Calibrating the Soil Moisture Sensor

Accurate soil moisture readings require proper calibration. Follow these steps:
   - Put the sensor in dry soil.
   - Press and hold the calibration button.
   - While holding the calibration button, briefly press the trigger button.
   - Continue holding the calibration button for less than 2 seconds and release it.
   - The blue LED will blink twice, indicating the start of `dry soil` calibration.
   - The device will complete the calibration, indicated by three blinks.
   - Place the sensor in fully wet soil, you have 5 seconds to do so.
   - The blue LED will blink twice, indicating the start of `wet soil` calibration.
   - The device will complete the `wet soil` calibration, indicated by three blinks.


> [!IMPORTANT]
>  ‚ö†Ô∏è Until the soil moisture sensor calibration is not performed, the sensor reading will be 0.



## 3. Wake Up Interval

| Solder Jumpers | interval selection |
|--------------|------------|
| ![Image 1](img/solder-jumper.jpg) |  You can change it by cutting the middle of the 1H Jumper. Then bridge the other jumper with the solder. Available intervals are 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, and 2h, plus every combination is possible.

# DIY
<img src="img/sens-kc-pcb.png"/>
This project is open-source, enabling you to assemble SOILSENS-V5W yourself. To make this easier, I've included an 'Interactive HTML BOM File' in the PCB folder, which guides you on where to solder each component and indicates polarity, minimizing the chance of errors. I've invested a lot of time and money into making this project open-source. Your support, whether through buying a ready-made device from my shop www.PricelessToolkit.com subscribing to my YouTube channel, or buying me a coffee, is greatly appreciated and helps fund future projects.

## Programming using Arduino IDE

1. - Open the provided code in the Arduino IDE.
2. - Install all neccecery libraries.
```c
      
   #include <esp_now.h>
   #include <WiFi.h>
   #include "driver/adc.h"
   #include "esp_adc_cal.h"
   #include "Wire.h"
   #include <SparkFunTMP102.h>
   #include <ArduinoJson.h>
   #include <AHT20.h>
   #include <Preferences.h>
   #include <WebServer.h>
   #include <PubSubClient.h>
           
```
  3. - Select the appropriate board and port parameters (refer to the provided screenshot for settings).
       
<img src="img/board_config.jpg"/>
       
  4. - Connect 3.3V USBTTL adapter to SOILSENS-V5W

   | Sensor Pin | Adapter Pin |
   |------------|-------------|
   | TX         | RX          |
   | RX         | TX          |
   | 3V3        | 3V3         |
   | GND        | GND         |

5. - Press and hold the **PRG** button on the sensor.
6. - While holding the **PRG** button, connect the USB to TTL adapter to the USB port of your computer.
7. - Click on the **Upload** button to upload the code to the sensor.


## 3D-Printed Case
The ideal material for the case is transparent and UV-resistant. ASA "UV-resistant" or ABS in white is the best choice as it allows light to enter, enabling the luminance sensor to function properly. For indoor use, consider translucent PETG to increase the luminance sensor's range and opt for a 3D-printed case with vent holes to ensure proper function of the air humidity and temperature sensors. For outdoor use, a case without vent holes is recommended to prevent water ingress during heavy! rain.

## Troubleshooting

 - Holding the calibration button.
    -  More than 3 seconds configuration mode.
    -  Less than 3 seconds Calibration mode.
- For connectivity issues in WiFi mode, verify the WiFi SSID, password, MAC, IP, Channel, and MQTT server details.
